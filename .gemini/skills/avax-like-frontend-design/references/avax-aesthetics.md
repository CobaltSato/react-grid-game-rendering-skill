# Avalanche Aesthetic Reference

Avalanche's design identity in one line: **"Red-based, sharp, high-performance, finance-infrastructure-grade clean Web3 UI."**

Compared to Ethereum (neutral/academic), Solana (flashy/neon/futuristic), and Polygon (pop/purple/light), Avalanche is **red, hard-edged, financial**.

## Color Palette

| Role | Values |
|---|---|
| Main | Deep red / crimson / magenta-leaning red |
| Gradients | Red → dark red → black, Red → purple → black |
| Base | Black / dark gray (`#0B0B0B` ~ `#111`) |
| Contrast | High (financial UI feel) |
| Feeling | Fire, magma, energy |

## Texture & Tone

| Element | Avalanche Tendency |
|---|---|
| Impression | Hard, fast, sharp |
| Emotion | Cool, not emotionally excessive |
| Audience | Developers, finance, enterprise |
| Tone | Serious, professional |
| Corners | Slightly sharp (not as round as Solana) |
| Glass effects | Restrained — no heavy glassmorphism |

## Typography

- Sans-serif, medium-to-bold weight
- Generous whitespace, information-hierarchy focused
- Keywords: readability, enterprise, infrastructure
- Target feel: "CTO/PM screen" not "gamer screen"

## Layout & UI Structure

- Card-based UI
- Dashboard patterns
- Clear left-nav or top-nav
- Numbers and status prominently displayed (TPS, validator count, network status)
- Overall feel: "blockchain control panel"

## Motion & Animation

- Not flashy — fast transitions
- Fade + light slide
- No over-the-top effects (no Solana-style "flashbang" animations)

## Implementation Quick Reference

When applying Avalanche flavor:

```
Background:  #0B0B0B ~ #111
Accent:      deep red gradient
Buttons:     small border-radius, subtle red glow
Numbers:     large, white or light gray
UI:          generous whitespace, high information density
```

## Context-Dependent Application

**Dark designs**: Deep blacks + crimson accents, high contrast, infrastructure feel.
**Light designs**: Cool grays + warm red touches, clean cards, enterprise clarity.
**Playful designs**: Sharpness as structural backbone — fast animations, decisive interactions even in whimsical contexts.

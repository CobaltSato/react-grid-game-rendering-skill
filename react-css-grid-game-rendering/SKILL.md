# React + CSS Grid Game Rendering Skill

This skill provides patterns and best practices for rendering grid-based games using React and CSS Grid. It is an alternative to using Canvas or WebGL for simpler grid-based games.

## Core Concepts

The main idea is to represent the game board as a CSS Grid and use React to render game objects (like players, enemies, and items) as DOM elements positioned on that grid.

## Getting Started

For a comprehensive guide on the patterns, best practices, and troubleshooting, please refer to the reference document:

- **[React + CSS Grid Game Rendering Patterns](references/react-css-grid-rendering.md)**

This document covers:
-   Setting up the grid layout.
-   Rendering tiles and game objects.
-   Handling dynamic positioning.
-   Performance considerations and best practices.
